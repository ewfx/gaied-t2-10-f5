## 🎯 Introduction
his project (GenAIEmailClassification) consists of multiple Python files (for example, the main email classification logic in email_classification.py and maintenance tasks in maintenance.py). It leverages several external libraries for tasks like text extraction, natural language processing, machine learning inference, duplicate detection, and scheduled maintenance.

Dependencies
Below is a list of the external libraries used throughout the project along with their pip installation commands:

numpy – for numerical operations
pip install numpy

requests – for making HTTP requests to external APIs (e.g., DeepSeek)
pip install requests

pdfplumber – for extracting text from PDF files
pip install pdfplumber

python-docx – for extracting text from DOCX files
pip install python-docx

spacy – for natural language processing
pip install spacy

python-dotenv – for loading environment variables
pip install python-dotenv

sentence-transformers – for encoding text and computing embeddings
pip install sentence-transformers

transformers – for inference using Hugging Face models
pip install transformers

scikit-learn – for similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity)
pip install scikit-learn

schedule – for scheduling the cleanup maintenance job
pip install schedule

pytesseract – for OCR-based text extraction from images (used as fallback in text extraction)
pip install pytesseract

Pillow – for image processing (used with OCR)
pip install pillow


## Install the Dependencies:
Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder (e.g., on your Windows machine), and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Since the project uses spaCy for text processing, download the English language model by running:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

   ```
